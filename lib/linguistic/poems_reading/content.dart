        "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",

    "content":
        "Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\nBut sad mortality o'ersways their power,\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\nO, how shall summer's honey breath hold out\nAgainst the wrackful siege of battering days,\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\nNor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?\nO fearful meditation! where, alack,\nShall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\nO, none, unless this miracle have might,\nThat in black ink my love may still shine bright.",

        "Let me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments. Love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove:\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\nWhose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle's compass come:\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\nIf this be error and upon me proved,\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.",

    "author": "William Blake",
    "content":
        "The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell.\nFor the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at the tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy whereas it now appears finite and corrupt.\nThis will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.\nBut first, the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\nIf the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is: infinite.\nFor man has closed himself up till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.",

        "O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,\nThe ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\nBut O heart! heart! heart!\nO the bleeding drops of red,\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\nFallen cold and dead.\n\nO Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\nRise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,\nFor you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,\nFor you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\nHere Captain! dear father!\nThis arm beneath your head!\nIt is some dream that on the deck,\nYou’ve fallen cold and dead.\n\nMy Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,\nMy father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,\nThe ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,\nFrom fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;\nExult O shores, and ring O bells!\nBut I with mournful tread,\nWalk the deck my Captain lies,\nFallen cold and dead.",

    "author": "Edgar Allan Poe",
    "content":
        "It was many and many a year ago,\nIn a kingdom by the sea,\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\nBy the name of Annabel Lee;\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\nThan to love and be loved by me.\n\nI was a child and she was a child,\nIn this kingdom by the sea,\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love—\nI and my Annabel Lee;\nWith a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven\nCoveted her and me.\n\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\nIn this kingdom by the sea,\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\nMy beautiful Annabel Lee;\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\nAnd bore her away from me,\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\nIn this kingdom by the sea.\n\nThe angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\nWent envying her and me—\nYes!—that was the reason (as all men know,\nIn this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\nChilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\n\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\nOf those who were older than we—\nOf many far wiser than we—\nAnd neither the angels in Heaven above\nNor the demons down under the sea\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;\n\nFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\nOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\nOf my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,\nIn her sepulchre there by the sea—\nIn her tomb by the sounding sea.",

    "content":
        "In the greenest of our valleys\nBy good angels tenanted,\nOnce a fair and stately palace—\nRadiant palace—reared its head.\nIn the monarch Thought's dominion—\nIt stood there!\nNever seraph spread a pinion\nOver fabric half so fair!\n\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\nOn its roof did float and flow,\n(This—all this—was in the olden\nTime long ago,)\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\nIn that sweet day,\nAlong the ramparts plumed and pallid,\nA wingèd odor went away.\n\nWanderers in that happy valley,\nThrough two luminous windows, saw\nSpirits moving musically\nTo a lute's well-tunèd law,\nRound about a throne where, sitting\n(Porphyrogene!)\nIn state his glory well-befitting,\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\n\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\nWas the fair palace door,\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing\nAnd sparkling evermore,\nA troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty\nWas but to sing,\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\nThe wit and wisdom of their king.\n\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\nAssailed the monarch's high estate;\n(Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow\nShall dawn upon him desolate!)\nAnd round about his home the glory\nThat blushed and bloomed\nIs but a dim-remembered story\nOf the old time entombed.\n\nAnd travellers, now, within that valley,\nThrough the red-litten windows see\nVast forms that move fantastically\nTo a discordant melody;\nWhile, like a ghastly rapid river,\nThrough the pale door\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\nAnd laugh—but smile no more.",

        "Lo! 'tis a gala night\nWithin the lonesome latter years!\nAn angel throng, bewinged, bedight\nIn veils, and drowned in tears,\nSit in a theatre, to see\nA play of hopes and fears,\nWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully\nThe music of the spheres.\nMimes, in the form of God on high,\nMutter and mumble low,\nAnd hither and thither fly—\nMere puppets they, who come and go\nAt bidding of vast formless things\nThat shift the scenery to and fro,\nFlapping from out their Condor wings\nInvisible Woe!\n\nThat motley drama—oh, be sure\nIt shall not be forgot!\nWith its Phantom chased for evermore\nBy a crowd that seize it not,\nThrough a circle that ever returneth in\nTo the self-same spot,\nAnd much of Madness, and more of Sin,\nAnd Horror the soul of the plot.\n\nBut see, amid the mimic rout\nA crawling shape intrude!\nA blood-red thing that writhes from out\nThe scenic solitude!\nIt writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs\nThe mimes become its food,\nAnd seraphs sob at vermin fangs\nIn human gore imbued.\n\nOut—out are the lights—out all!\nAnd, over each quivering form,\nThe curtain, a funeral pall,\nComes down with the rush of a storm,\nWhile the angels, all pallid and wan,\nUprising, unveiling, affirm\nThat the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"\nAnd its hero, the Conqueror Worm.",
