It holds a collection of assets, which might include stocks, bonds, or commodities, depending on the fund's focus. For instance, an ETF might track the S&P 500 index, meaning it holds stocks from the top 500 companies in the U.S., giving investors broad market exposure through one security. Some ETFs focus on specific sectors like technology or healthcare, while others may follow commodities such as gold. One of the main benefits of investing in ETFs is diversification—owning a broad selection of assets—which reduces risk. Additionally, ETFs offer the flexibility of trading throughout the day, much like stocks, as opposed to mutual funds which are only priced once daily.",

Passively managed ETFs aim to replicate the performance of an index, like the S&P 500, with minimal management intervention, keeping costs low. Actively managed ETFs, on the other hand, have portfolio managers making buying and selling decisions to try to beat a benchmark index, which can result in higher fees due to more frequent trading. Regardless of the management style, ETFs usually have lower expense ratios than mutual funds, making them a cost-effective choice for many investors.",
