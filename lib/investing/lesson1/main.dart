This happens because more money chases the same goods and services. For instance, if the government doubles the money supply without boosting production, prices roughly double too.

Kiyosaki emphasizes the concept of making money work for you by investing in assets (as he said, 'Make money work for you'). These could be stocks of companies, real estate properties, businesses, or other income-generating ventures. Assets are the key to financial independence because they generate passive income and increase in value over time. In simple words, you do nothing, and money flows into your pockets.",
