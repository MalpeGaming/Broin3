    "question":
        "What is a key feature of cryptocurrencies compared to traditional currencies?",
    "answers": [
      "They are issued by central banks",
      "They are always more stable than traditional currencies",
      "They use cryptography for security and operate on decentralized networks",
      "They are backed by physical assets like gold or silver",
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation":
        "The answer is C) They use cryptography for security and operate on decentralized networks. This makes them different from traditional currencies, which are centrally issued and controlled.\n\nBlockchain is the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a digital ledger distributed across a network of computers. It records all cryptocurrency transactions, with each transaction grouped into a 'block.' These blocks are linked together, creating a chronological chain of data known as a blockchain. Each block contains a cryptographic link to the previous block, which ensures that no one can tamper with the transaction history without altering all subsequent blocks, making the blockchain very secure. This structure ensures the integrity and transparency of the data, making it resistant to tampering and fraud.",

  {
    "question": "What is one main purpose of blockchain technology?",
    "answers": [
      "To create physical ledgers for recording transactions",
      "To facilitate decentralized, transparent, and secure transaction records",
      "To eliminate the need for all currencies",
      "To generate unlimited cryptocurrencies",
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation":
        "The answer is B) To facilitate decentralized, transparent, and secure transaction records. Blockchain technology ensures that transactions are recorded in a way that cannot easily be tampered with.\n\nMiners are essential participants in blockchain networks. They operate powerful computers that solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. This process, known as mining, secures the network and prevents fraudulent transactions. Miners are incentivized through rewards, typically in the form of newly created cryptocurrency. For instance, Bitcoin miners receive newly created bitcoins as a reward for each block they successfully add to the blockchain, which helps sustain the decentralized network.",

    "question": "What is the main purpose of miners in blockchain networks?",
    "answers": [
      "To store large amounts of cryptocurrencies",
      "To validate transactions and add them to the blockchain",
      "To buy and sell cryptocurrencies",
      "To create digital wallets",
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation":
        "The answer is B) To validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain network.\n\nCrypto Security is crucial because digital assets are attractive targets for hackers and thieves. Cryptocurrency wallets store these digital assets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, making them convenient for transactions but also more vulnerable to hacks. Cold wallets, on the other hand, store cryptocurrencies offline and thus provide better protection. Users can enhance the security of their crypto assets by using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and employing hardware wallets that store private keys offline.",

    "question":
        "Which type of wallet provides the best security for storing cryptocurrencies?",
    "answers": [
      "Hot wallet",
      "Exchange wallet",
      "Cold wallet",
      "Online wallet",
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation":
        "The answer is C) Cold wallet. Cold wallets, being offline, are less susceptible to hacking compared to hot wallets that are connected to the internet.\n\nCrypto Transactions occur on blockchain networks, where each transaction is recorded in a public ledger. A sender needs a private key to sign a transaction before broadcasting it to the network, ensuring that only authorized transactions can occur. Miners then validate the transaction, and once approved, it is added to the blockchain. This transparent process prevents double-spending, which happens when the same cryptocurrency unit is used more than once in transactions. The blockchain's distributed nature and validation by miners prevent this by ensuring that each transaction is unique.",

  {
    "question": "What prevents double-spending in cryptocurrency transactions?",
    "answers": [
      "The encryption used in private keys",
      "The blockchain's distributed ledger and validation by miners",
      "The centralized control of cryptocurrencies",
      "The hardware wallets used to store cryptocurrency",
